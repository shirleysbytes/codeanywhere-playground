# Overview
Small project built using _only_ [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com)! Project jumps to a few different target websites and grabs a screenshot for trying to find a PS5!

### Next Steps
Need to add script for setup including installing chrome. Also need to update script to check for a cart button and throw an error if not found (helps prevent the need to download screenshot artifacts). Also need to run GH Action on a schedule if possible
